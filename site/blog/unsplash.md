I wondered what would happen if I uploaded some of my photos to unsplash, a creative commons stock photography site.

I've always been interested in making useful things and I was curious if anyone would use my photos if I uploaded them to [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@bsunter "Unsplash"). By uploading them to Unsplash, I make the photo free for use without credit. I included the location and a few tags in the description.

This is their license:
>All photos published on Unsplash can be used for free. You can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or Unsplash, although it is appreciated when possible.

Here is the image I uploaded of some spring rolls I made in a Thai cooking class in Chiang Mai. It was my first time ever making spring rolls and I thought they turned out pretty well.

## Reverse Google Image Search
A few years later, I did a reverse Google image search and was amazed at all the places the image was being used. It was being used in everything from Chinese take out menus in the UK to Thai travel brochures to blogs about “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome”

Here are a few of my favorites:

## Menus
It looks like I made it on to some sort of template because I was on many online ordering menus from all over the world. It looks like I was usually being advertised as Chinese egg rolls.

## Blogs
I was on a number of blogs on subjects like Chinese restaurant syndrome, Chinese travel tips, spring rolls vs egg rolls, and on Filipino Lumpia.

## Travel Brochure
I think my overall favorite was being on a Thai travel brochure for Chiang Mai, which is where I actually cooked the spring rolls.

# Creative Commons
I'm very happy that so many people found use of my pictures in so many different ways. I'm definitely going to host more pictures on unsplash and seeing where they wind up.
