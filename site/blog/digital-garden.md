I've started publishing some of my Obsidian notes on my personal site. Publishing my notes encourages me to understand a subject to the point I could explain it to someone else, and hopefully others will find it useful and/or interesting.

For the past few years I've been really interested in the idea of notetaking. Before, I discounted the concept as a distraction or busywork, but I now view it as a form of active learning.There are so many books and concepts over the years that I've completely forgotten. If I have a good self contained note on a concept, I can refresh my memory quickly and easily.

## Inspiration
There are a number of trends that have inspired me to share my notes online.

### How to Take Smart Notes and the Zettlekasten Method

There are a couple of "name brand" note taking techniques, but the one I leverage most often is one called Zettlekasten, described in detail in the book [How to Take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bsunter-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2b96331a9c61f60c0373471a1cfcc975&camp=1789&creative=9325). This method is intensive, but I tell myself if something is worth reading, it's usually worth remembering.

I loosely follow this technique and try to stick to the general principles. Here are the main ideas
- Create an inbox to capture random thoughts, so you don't forget them later. You will forget them if you don't write them down. These are called "Fleeting notes".
- Take notes while reading and reword each concept into a few sentences that someone with a basic familiarity of the field would be able to understand. These are called "Literature Notes".
- Carefully distill your "Literature Notes" and "Fleeting Notes" into "Permanent Notes" or "Evergreen Notes", which are "permanently" useful across a wide variety of topics. 
	- For example, you could have a note titled "Understanding requires effortful engagement" with a description of that idea and references to it across from many different types of notes. 
- Make dense connections between notes and wait for topics to naturally emerge, instead of categorizing notes or deciding what you'll write about up front.

### Next Generation Productivity Apps
I complete agree with Conor White-Sullivan of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) that [some productivity tools are better than others](https://twitter.com/conaw/status/1198399750032232449?lang=en). Your productivity system can't and shouldn't be tool agnostic. I spent a long time trying to make tools like Evernote, Onenote, Omnifocus work, but the notes in folder paradigm just doesn't suit my workflow.

There are a number of new productivity tools and ideas that are much more flexible, most of which are built around the concept of "backlinks". The big idea here is instead of putting notes in folder, you have a graph of related notes. Backlinks are different than normal "one way" hyper links because they are "bi directional". Each page "knows" what other pages link to it. This allows relationships between concepts to emerge and evolve over time, rather than needing you to manually catgorize notes by putting them in folders. You can easily view each pages backlinks to discover related concepts. See [Maggie Appleton's Blog](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) for a great summary of the backlinks and bidrectional links.

There are a number of good tools in this area now. Here are some of my personal favorites:

#### Roam Research
[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) is really powerful yet user friendly note taking web app. It has a lot of good defaults like bullet outlining and daily notes. I use this for most of my personal notes. I heavily use the daily view to capture unstructured thoughts and task management. Another killer feature is realtime multi user collaboration like google docs. The only downsides are that it is expensive at $15 dollars a month and it doesn't have a native app (although the mobile web app is quite good).

#### Obsidian
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free dektop and mobile app that manages your notes as markdown files locally. It works well with git, and has good security since it manages everything locally. It's relatively user friendly, but not quite as convenient as a managed web app and doesn't have realtime collaboration. It has a lot of plugins and allows you to develop your own plugins easily. It's centered more around markdown files than a bullet outliner like Roam, so I use this for managing these public notes. 

#### Notion
[https://www.notion.so/](https://www.notion.so/) is the most popular new knowledge management app, and the one I would reccomend most to someone getting started, since it's the most user friendly and free. I've tried it and like it a lot, but Roam and Obsidian suit my personal needs a bit better.
