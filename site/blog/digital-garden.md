excerpt: I've started publishing some of my Obsidian notes on my personal site. Publishing my notes encourages me to understand a subject to the point I could explain it to someone else, and hopefully others will find it useful and/or intersting.

I've started publishing some of my notes on my personal site. Publishing my notes encourages me to understand a subject well enough to explain it to someone else, and hopefully others will find it useful and/or interesting.

## What is the difference between a note and a blog post? 
A blog post is the most common web page format since the early 2010s. A blog post is a 1500-2500 word polished essay with a timestamp, listed in reverse chronological order. These types of posts are written once and minimally updated. Most popular web publishing software like Wordpress, Tumblr, and Blogger steer you to this format by default. This format is popular for a reason. It's good for SEO and for sharing on social media.

### Notes are shorter and more interconnected
A note is different than a blog post or essay. First of all, a note can be extremely short. Blog posts are meant to read on their own, but notes are most useful in context and in relation to other notes. 

Using short notes also reduces friction in sharing something useful. I might not want to write a blog post just to share a few useful programming commands I learned recently.

### Not Time Based
Second, a note doesn't usually have a timestamp. They're never finished. They're intended to continually be updated and evolve. 

Not all types of useful information fit into this essay-time pattern.
The date isn't relevent to my notes on [[tree]] data structures and my notes aren't organized by time. As I learn more, the page will continue to grow.

## Inspiration
For the past few years I've been interested in the idea of notetaking. Before, I discounted the concept as a distraction or busywork, but now I view taking notes as a form of active learning. I've completely forgotten so many books and concepts over the years. If I have a good self contained note on a concept, I can refresh my memory quickly and easily.

There are a number of trends that have inspired me to take notes and share them online.

### Building a Second Brain
Productivity blogger Tiago Forte has a number of useful articles on [Building a Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) and the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) which explain how we can remember what we learn and put it to use.

> How many brilliant ideas have you had and forgotten? How many insights have you failed to take action on? How much useful advice have you slowly forgotten as the years have passed?

He encourages us to systematically save our ideas to advance our goals in the real world.

> Building a Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we’ve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.

He emphasizes that we shouldn't just learn and collect notes aimlesslessly. We should always learn with a purpose and the intention of putting our knowledge to use. We should be trying to accomplish goals or help others accomplish theirs.

> Whether we want to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or contribute to a cause we believe in, the true purpose of learning is to turn our knowledge into effective action.

This close connection between project management and knowledge management is enabled by the latest generation of productivity apps and tools.

### Show Your Work Book
I discovered a book called ["Show Your Work!: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered" by Austin Kleon](https://www.amazon.com/Show-Your-Work-Austin-Kleon/dp/076117897X?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bsunter-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=22458404a31b3fb0eadd25a1eedf51ef&camp=1789&creative=9325) through a productivity blogger named [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyVpRiqOvt4). The book only takes 30 minutes to read and is excellent, so I highly reccomend it.

The book encourages you to share your thoughts and your work-in-progress online, even if you're not an expert, so others with similar interests can follow along with you.

> Imagine if your next boss didn’t have to read your résumé because he already reads your blog. Imagine being a student and getting your first gig based on a school project you posted online. Imagine losing your job but having a social network of people familiar with your work and ready to help you find a new one. Imagine turning a side project or a hobby into your profession because you had a following that could support you.

The book does a really good job of selling you on the idea that your perspectives, even as a beginner, are valuable, especially to other beginners.

> The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten. - C.S. Lewis

Even something as simple as sharing a list of resources you found helpful can be beneficial to others. 

> The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and video. Take people step-by-step through part of your process. As blogger Kathy Sierra says, “make people better at something they want to be better at"

The book gives you a good kick to stop holding back out of fear of embarassment and start putting yourself out there.

> It’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable.

### Other Digital Gardens
Websites felt much more free form in the early Geocities day of the internet. Now, it feels like almost all websites are standardized and organized in reverse chronological "blog" format. The digital garden movement is a return to a Wikipedia style web of links.



### Next Generation Productivity Apps
I complete agree with Conor White-Sullivan of [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) that [some productivity tools are better than others](https://twitter.com/conaw/status/1198399750032232449?lang=en). Your productivity system can't be completely tool agnostic. I spent a long time trying to make tools like Evernote, Onenote, Omnifocus work, but the notes in folder paradigm just doesn't suit my workflow.

There are a number of new productivity tools and ideas that are much more flexible, most of which are built around the concept of "backlinks". The big idea here is instead of putting notes in folder, you have a graph of related notes. Backlinks are different than normal "one way" hyper links because they are "bi directional". Each page "knows" what other pages link to it. This allows relationships between concepts to emerge and evolve over time, rather than requiring you to manually catgorize and recategorize notes by putting them in folders. You can easily view each pages backlinks to discover related concepts. See [Maggie Appleton's Blog](https://maggieappleton.com/bidirectionals) for a great summary of the backlinks and bidrectional links.

There are a number of good tools in this space now. Here are some of my personal favorites:

#### Roam Research
[Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) is really powerful yet user friendly note taking web app. It has a lot of good defaults like bullet outlining and daily notes. I use this for most of my personal notes. I heavily use the daily view to capture unstructured thoughts and task management. Another great feature is realtime multi user collaboration like google docs. The only downsides are that it is expensive at $15 dollars a month and it doesn't have a native app (although the mobile web app is quite good).

#### Obsidian
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a free dektop and mobile app that manages your notes as markdown files locally. It works well with git, and has good security since it manages everything locally. It's relatively user friendly, but not quite as convenient as a managed web app and doesn't have realtime collaboration. It has a lot of plugins and allows you to develop your own plugins easily. It's centered more around markdown files than a bullet outliner like Roam, so I use this for managing these public notes. 

#### Notion
[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is the most popular new knowledge management app, and the one I would reccomend most to someone getting started, since it's the most user friendly and free. I've tried it and like it a lot, but Roam and Obsidian suit my personal needs a bit better as a power user.

### How to Take Smart Notes and the Zettlekasten Method
There are a number of "name brand" note taking techniques, but the one I leverage most often is one called Zettlekasten, described in detail in the book [How to Take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens](https://www.amazon.com/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bsunter-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=2b96331a9c61f60c0373471a1cfcc975&camp=1789&creative=9325). This method is intensive compared to casual reading. I tell myself if something is worth reading, it's usually worth putting in the effort to remember it.

I loosely follow this technique and try to stick to the general principles. Here are the main ideas
- Create an inbox to capture random thoughts, so you don't forget them later. You will forget them if you don't write them down. These are called "Fleeting notes".
- Take notes while reading and reword each concept into a few sentences that someone with a basic familiarity of the field would be able to understand. These are called "Literature Notes".
- Carefully distill your "Literature Notes" and "Fleeting Notes" into "Permanent Notes" or "Evergreen Notes", which are "permanently" useful across a wide variety of topics. 
    - What should be come a permanent note is highly subjective and personalized. My personal litmus test is if it's one of those ideas that once you notice, you start seeing it everywhere, like "correlation vs causation".
- Make dense connections between notes and wait for topics to naturally emerge, instead of categorizing notes up front.

### POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere
So much content on the internet is now hosted and locked inside big platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. There are a number of obvious upsides to hosting content on big platforms, like user base and ease of getting started, but there are significant downsides. Over a long period of time, your content will likely be put behind spammy login popups, paywalls, or be lost. I've hosted this site, https://briansunter.com since 2005, before Twitter or Reddit were created. See [POSSE - Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) for more details on this line of thinking. Your content is valuable and you should own it.
