You make sourdough bread with a natural starter instead of instant yeast or baking powder.

Baking sourdough bread is a fun and scientific hobby, and it requires quite a bit of planning, but the results are impressive. It's almost impossible to get never-been-cooled bread unless you [[cooking|bake it yourself]].

## Concepts

### Yeast and Fermentation

- Sourdough bread uses natural yeast from Starter instead of instant yeast like most store-bought bread
- Some studies show natural yeast is easier to digest [^8]
- Both Starter and instant yeast cause the dough to rise by producing gas
- Starter is a mixture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria [^4]
- The yeast and bacteria produce the CO2 gas that causes the bread to rise[^6]
- The bacteria produce lactic acid, which contributes flavor and sourness
- Both yeast and bacteria primarily originate from the flour (very little from the air)[^6]
- Bacteria usually outnumbers yeast 100:1. Although bacteria produce less gas than yeast, there's a higher proportion of bacteria. Overall, bacteria contribute 50% of the CO2, and yeast contributes the other 50%. [^6]
- Both yeast and bacteria occasionally need air to survive
- Flour is 75% starch. For bacteria and yeast to digest starch, something else must break it into simpler sugars.
- Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars usable by yeast and bacteria. [^7]
- Amylase is naturally present in flour but can be enhanced with the addition of malt flour [^6]

## Sourdough Ingredients

- ### Bread Flour

  - I recommend King Arthur brand bread flour
  - Bread flour has a higher protein than other types. It has 11-13% protein vs. all-purpose flour, which has 9-11% [^1]
  - Bread flour is "chewier" than all-purpose flour.
  - The higher protein in bread flour produces more gluten, which traps air during the fermentation process to create airy holes.
  - I only use this for baking, not for feeding my Starter, since it is more expensive than other types, especially during the quarantine breadmaking craze.

- ### Rye Flour

  - Rye flour produces the strongest fermentation and sour flavors [^2].
  - Starters with Rye mature faster than other types
  - It has less protein than other types of flour, so the dough is less stretchy and fluffy
  - Rye is expensive and hard to find, so you shouldn't use more than necessary to feed your Starter
  - I feed my Starter with 50/50 Rye and All-Purpose Flour
  - To have a more mild Starter yet still have vigorous fermentation, use a 10% rye blend in your Starter.

- ### Wheat Flour [^2]

  - This flour includes the whole grain of wheat, including the bran, endosperm, and germ.
  - Including bran can inhibit gluten development. Bran disrupts the bonds formed in a gluten matrix.
  - It provides faster fermentation, second to rye
  - I occasionally use a mixture of 90% bread flour and 10% wheat for flavor.

- ### Rice Flour

  - Rice flour doesn't contain gluten, so it doesn't become sticky
  I use this to dust some of my workspaces and proof baskets, so the dough comes off easily.

- ### Water

  - The type of water isn't that important, but the temperature throughout the process is essential.
  - The ideal temperature for fermentation is around 75 F, but you may want to adjust fermentation times depending on your schedule.
  - Don't let hot (95+ F) water touch your Starter or dough

- ### Starter

  - I feed my starter 50g Rye flour, 50g all-purpose flour, and 100g water daily, which produces vigorous fermentation and sour flavor
  - Use 10g Rye and 90g all-purpose flour for a less sour starter
- [See my recipe here](/recipes/sourdough-starter/)

## Tools

- ### Baking Container

  - A dutch oven is the cheapest and most versatile. However, lowering the dough into a hot container with high walls is dangerous.
  - An excellent dutch oven like the enamel Lodge costs around $100. Others like the Cruset brand are more expensive and probably not worth it
  - Dedicated breadmaking pans with low walls and a tall lid are the best options but are expensive and cost $250+. You can only use them for breadmaking, unlike the other options.
  - A cast iron dutch oven all in one is another excellent option. It has lower walls, so you can safely get the loaf inside, and I wouldn't use it independently as a cast-iron due to having to clean it so often.

- ### Parchment Paper

  - Strong paper to lower your dough into your dutch oven

- ### Starter Jar

  - I recommend a small pyrex with low walls because it's much easier to clean.
  - Most people use a mason jar, which helps see the starter rise and fall, but is more difficult to feed and clean.

- ### Stand Mixer or Hand dough mixer

  - I love my stand mixer, but they're expensive
  - A hand dough mixer works well too
- Proofing basket
  - A small woven basket with some cloth for shaping your bread and letting it ferment a bit longer.
  - I initially thought these were unnecessary, but they help shape the dough and make it easy to remove from the bowl.
  - Making it easy to remove is crucial because you don't want to degas or rip your dough after days of hard work making it fluffy.
  - I cover these with a big ziplock bag in my fridge
- Silicone Spatula
  - Highly recommended for nonstick mixing
  - I like the silicone spoons.
- Temperature Probe
  - I like taking the temperature of my ingredients as I work and adjusting fermentation times based on that[^3]. Not necessary in the beginning, but very useful for getting consistent results and learning from your experiences.
  
## Detailed Steps

1. ### Prepare Starter

   - You should have a mature sourdough starter ahead of time. See my [recipe for making sourdough starter](../recipes/sourdough-starter/) or buy one online and follow its instructions.
   - I recommend feeding the Starter for two weeks before baking with it.
   - Sourdough starter is mature when it doubles in size 5 hours after feeding.
   - Feed Starter twice daily two days leading up to baking.

2. ### Make Levain

- Levain is when you take a portion of your Starter and mix it with flour and water. This levain mixture is used in its entirety when baking your bread, which is why you leave behind some Starter.
- Starter is an ongoing live culture continuously fed and never wholly used in any given bake. In contrast, Levain is an offshoot of your Starter where you use all of it in your final bake.
- Remove a portion of your Starter to use in the levain
- For making two loaves, I usually remove 33 grams of Starter.
- Replace the Starter you removed with equal parts flour and water back into the starter jar to "feed" it.
  - Note the amount of stater removed for the levain in grams using a digital scale.
  - Add that same amount of flour and water back into the jar.
- Mix the Starter you removed with flour and water
- I usually mix 40g starter, 80g bread flour, and 80g water.
- Let the levain ferment for at least five and up to 8 hours at room temperature.
- It should be ready when it doubles in size.
- You can use the float test as a rough gauge if your levain is ready.
  - If it floats, it is likely ready to use for baking.
  - If it doesn't float, it may still be ready to bake depending on the type of flour or hydration level you use. The float test can lead to false negatives. [^9]

3. ### Autolyse

- Autolyse is mixing flour and water before adding salt or yeast and letting it sit for 20 minutes.
- Autolyse is intended to allow extra time for the flour to "hydrate" by absorbing the water.
- This is supposed to improve gluten development and reduce the need for intensive mixing
- I do this simultaneously while preparing the levain, so it doesn't add time to my recipe.
- Some people claim doing autolyse isn't worth it. It seems only to add a little bit of volume [^10]
