Baking sourdough bread is a fun and scientific hobby. It requires quite a bit of planning, but the results are amazing. It's almost impossible to get freshly baked bread otherwise unless you bake it yourself.

## Sourdough Ingredients

- Bread Flour
  - I recommend King Arthur brand bread flour
  - Bread flour has a higher protein than other types. It has 11-13% protein vs all purpose flour which has 9-11% [^1]
  - Bread flour is "chewier" than all purpose flour.
  - The higher protein in bread flour producers more gluten, which traps air during the fermentation process to produce the airy holes.
  - I only use this for baking, not for feeding my starter, since it is more expensive than other types, especially during the quarantine breadmaking craze.

- Rye Flour [^2]
  - Rye flour produces the strongest fermentation and sour flavors.
  - Starters with Rye mature faster than other types
  - It has less protein than other types of flour, so the dough is less stretchy and fluffy
  - Rye is expensive and hard to find, so you shouldn't use more than neccesary to feed your starter
  - I feed my starter with 50/50 Rye and All Purpose Flour
  - To have a more mild starter, yet still have strong fermentation, use a 10% rye blend in your starter.

- Wheat Flour [^2]
  - This flour includes the whole grain of wheat, including the bran, endosperm, and germ.
  - Including bran can inhibit gluten development. Bran disrupts the bonds formed in a gluten matrix.
  - It provides faster fermentation, second to rye
  - I use a mixture such 10% wheat and 90% bread flour for flavor.

- Rice Flour
  - Rice flour doesn't contain gluten, so it doesn't become sticky
  - I use this for dusting some of my work spaces and proofing baskets so the dough comes off easily.

- Water
  - The type of water isn't that important, but the temperature throughout the process is important.
  - The ideal temperature for fermentation is around 75 F, but you may want to adjust fermentation times depending on your schedule.
  - Don't let hot (95+ F) water touch your starter or dough

- Starter
  - I feed my starter 50g Rye flour, 50g all purpose flour, and 100g water daily, which produces strong fermentation and sour flavor
  - Use 10g Rye and 90g all purpose flour for a less sour starter

## Tools

- Container for baking your bread.
  - A dutch oven is the cheapest and most versatile, however lowering the dough into the hot container with high walls are kind of dangerous.
  - A good dutch oven like the enamel Lodge costs around $100, others like the Cruset are more expensive and probably not worth it
  - Dedicated bread making pans with low walls and a tall lid are the best options, but are expensive and cost $250+. You can only use them for bread-making unlike the other options.
  - A cast iron dutch oven all in one is another really good option. I don't see using the cast iron in this set, due to the cleaning required.
- Parchment Paper
  - Strong paper to lower your dough into your dutch oven
- Starter Jar
  - I recommend a small pyrex with low walls because it's much easier to clean.
  - Most people use a mason jar, which helps to see the starter rise and fall, but is more difficult to feed and clean.
- Stand Mixer or Hand dough mixer
  - I really love my stand mixer but they're expensive
  - A hand dough mixer works really well too
- Proofing basket
  - A small woven basket with some cloth for shaping your bread and letting it ferment a bit longer.
  - I originally thought these were unnecessary, but they really do help shape the dough and make it easy to remove from the bowl.
  - Making it easy to remove is important, because you don't want to degas or rip your dough after days of hard work
  - I cover these with a big ziplock bag in my fridge
- Silicone Spatula
  - Highly recommended for nonstick mixing
  - I really like the silicone spoons.
- Temperature Probe
  - I really like taking the temperature of my ingredients as I work and adjusting fermentation times based on that. Not necessary in the beginning but very useful for getting consistent result and learning from your experiences.
