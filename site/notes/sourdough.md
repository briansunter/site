Sourdough bread is bread made with a natural starter, as opposed to instant yeast or baking powder. 

Baking sourdough bread is a fun and scientific hobby. It requires quite a bit of planning, but the results are amazing. It's almost impossible to get never-been-cooled bread unless you [[cooking|bake it yourself]].


## Steps Overview
These are the basic steps and timings to make an artisan sourdough loaf. There are more detailed steps below.

1. Make Starter (0 - 48 hours)
1. Make Levain (5-8 hours)
1. Autolyse (optional, 0-3 hours)
1. Mix Dough (15 minutes)
1. Bulk Fermentation (6 hours at 75 F, 24-48 hours in fridge at 50 F)
   1. Optionally folding up to 4 times throughout the process for extra poofy bread.
2. Shape + Rest (20 - 40 minutes)
3. Proof (2 hours at 75 F, 8-16 hours in fridge at 50 F)
4. Scoring (5 minutes)
5. Baking (50 minutes)

## Concepts

### Yeast and Fermentation

- Sourdough bread uses natural yeast from starter instead of instant yeast like most store bought bread
- There are some studies that show natural yeast is healthier
- Both starter and instant yeast cause the dough to rise by producing gas
- Starter is a mixture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria [^4]
- The yeast and bacteria produce the CO2 gas that causes the bread to rise[^6]
- The bacteria produces lactic acid, which contributes flavor and sourness
- Both yeast and bacteria primarily originate from the flour (not air)[^6]
- Bacteria usually outnumbers yeast 100:1. Although bacteria produces less gas than yeast, there's a greater number of bacteria. Overall, bacteria contributes 50% of the CO2 and yeast contributes the other 50%. [^6]
- Both yeast and bacteria occasionally need air to survive
- Flour is 75% starch, in order for starch to be used by the bacteria and yeast, it must be broken down into simpler sugars.
- Amylase is an enzyme that breaks down starch into simpler sugars usable by the yeast and bacteria. [^7]
- Amylase is naturally present in flour but can be enhanced with the addition of malt flour [^6]

## Sourdough Ingredients

- Bread Flour
  - I recommend King Arthur brand bread flour
  - Bread flour has a higher protein than other types. It has 11-13% protein vs all purpose flour which has 9-11% [^1]
  - Bread flour is "chewier" than all purpose flour.
  - The higher protein in bread flour producers more gluten, which traps air during the fermentation process to produce the airy holes.
  - I only use this for baking, not for feeding my starter, since it is more expensive than other types, especially during the quarantine breadmaking craze.

- Rye Flour [^2]
  - Rye flour produces the strongest fermentation and sour flavors.
  - Starters with Rye mature faster than other types
  - It has less protein than other types of flour, so the dough is less stretchy and fluffy
  - Rye is expensive and hard to find, so you shouldn't use more than necessary to feed your starter
  - I feed my starter with 50/50 Rye and All Purpose Flour
  - To have a more mild starter, yet still have strong fermentation, use a 10% rye blend in your starter.

- Wheat Flour [^2]
  - This flour includes the whole grain of wheat, including the bran, endosperm, and germ.
  - Including bran can inhibit gluten development. Bran disrupts the bonds formed in a gluten matrix.
  - It provides faster fermentation, second to rye
  - I occasionally use a mixture such 10% wheat and 90% bread flour for flavor.

- Rice Flour
  - Rice flour doesn't contain gluten, so it doesn't become sticky
  - I use this for dusting some of my work spaces and proofing baskets so the dough comes off easily.

- Water
  - The type of water isn't that important, but the temperature throughout the process is important.
  - The ideal temperature for fermentation is around 75 F, but you may want to adjust fermentation times depending on your schedule.
  - Don't let hot (95+ F) water touch your starter or dough

- Starter
  - I feed my starter 50g Rye flour, 50g all purpose flour, and 100g water daily, which produces strong fermentation and sour flavor
  - Use 10g Rye and 90g all purpose flour for a less sour starter
- [See my recipe here](/recipes/sourdough-starter/)

## Tools

- Container for baking your bread.
  - A dutch oven is the cheapest and most versatile, however lowering the dough into the hot container with high walls are kind of dangerous.
  - A good dutch oven like the enamel Lodge costs around $100, others like the Cruset are more expensive and probably not worth it
  - Dedicated bread making pans with low walls and a tall lid are the best options, but are expensive and cost $250+. You can only use them for bread-making unlike the other options.
  - A cast iron dutch oven all in one is another really good option. I don't see using the cast iron in this set, due to the cleaning required.
- Parchment Paper
  - Strong paper to lower your dough into your dutch oven
- Starter Jar
  - I recommend a small pyrex with low walls because it's much easier to clean.
  - Most people use a mason jar, which helps to see the starter rise and fall, but is more difficult to feed and clean.
- Stand Mixer or Hand dough mixer
  - I really love my stand mixer but they're expensive
  - A hand dough mixer works really well too
- Proofing basket
  - A small woven basket with some cloth for shaping your bread and letting it ferment a bit longer.
  - I originally thought these were unnecessary, but they really do help shape the dough and make it easy to remove from the bowl.
  - Making it easy to remove is important, because you don't want to degas or rip your dough after days of hard work
  - I cover these with a big ziplock bag in my fridge
- Silicone Spatula
  - Highly recommended for nonstick mixing
  - I really like the silicone spoons.
- Temperature Probe
  - I really like taking the temperature of my ingredients as I work and adjusting fermentation times based on that[^3]. Not necessary in the beginning but very useful for getting consistent result and learning from your experiences.
  
## Detailed Steps

1. ### Prepare Starter
   - You should have a mature sourdough starter ahead of time. See my [recipe for making sourdough starter](../recipes/sourdough-starter/) or buy one online and follow its instructions.
   - Sourdough starter is mature when it doubles in size 5 hours after feeding.
   - Feed starter twice daily 2 days leading up to baking, ideally feeding 5 hours before starting baking.
1. ### Make Levain
