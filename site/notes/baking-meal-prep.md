Turns out you can meal prep freshly baked bread. I use a vacuum sealer to freeze individual servings of dough for things like dinner rolls and loafs. This way I can have amazing freshly baked breads whenever I want them.

## Why Bake at Home?
Freshly baked bread straight from the oven is one of the tastiest things in the world. Even bread a couple hours old isn't nearly as good. This means if you want fresh bread, the best option is to [[cooking|bake it yourself]] unless you live on top of a bakery.

## Problems with Traditional Baking
It's pretty straightforward to make tasty bread at home. All you need is decent flour, yeast, and a digital scale. However, there are a number of downsides:

First, finely ground flour is really messy and I don't like cleaning my kitchen so often. 

Second, I don't like preparing huge quantities of baked goods at a time. I think they're only really worth the calories straight out of the oven. I'm tempted to eat more than I should when they're fresh and the next day it isn't worth the calories. I really just want one glorious dinner roll with dinner. It's ok if it's 250 empty calories if it's really good and I only eat one.

## Bulk Prepare, Vacuum Seal, and Freeze
Meal prepping your dough solves a lot of these problems.

First, I prepare the dough according to the recipe until the first rise. I usually prep 2-4x the amount of the recipe.

Next, I punch down the dough, roll it out, and shape it.

Then I let the rolls rise again half way through their second proof, then freeze it for 4 hours.

Finally, I individually vaccuum seal individual servings and keep them in the freezer.

## Reheating
On the days you want bread, move the dough to the fridge and let it thaw for 4 hours. Then take the dough out and let it rise at room temperature for a few hours. You can then continue on the recipe as normal.
