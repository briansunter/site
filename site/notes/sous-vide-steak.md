An incredibly easy and tasty way to prepare steak.

## Instructions

- 2 (1 1/2â€“ to 2-inch-thick) ribeye, strip, porterhouse, or T-bone steaks (about 1 pound/450g each), or 4 tenderloin steaks (6 to 8 ounces/170 to 225g each)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 sprigs thyme or rosemary 
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable, canola, or rice bran oil
- 2 tablespoons (30g) butter

## Ingredients

1. Preheat a sous vide cooker to desired final temperature. Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Place in sous vide bags along with herbs, garlic, and shallots and distribute evenly. Seal bags and place in water bath for desired time according to charts.
2. Gently lay steak in skillet, using your fingers or a set of tongs. If desired, add a tablespoon of butter; for a cleaner-tasting sear, omit the butter at this stage.
3. After 15 to 30 seconds, flip steak so that the second side comes into contact with the pan. Repeat, flipping steak every 15 to 30 seconds, until it has developed a nice brown sear, about 1 1/2 minutes total. If you did not add butter earlier, add butter to skillet about 30 seconds before steak is done for added richness. Serve steak immediately
