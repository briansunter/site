Uncommon ingredients and techniques that improve food. 


## Sous Vide
Cooks foods inside a vaccum bag immersed in hot water. This is my favorite cooking method because it's so easy, the food is so flavorful, and it's good for meal prep and cooking bulk proteins


## Instant Pot Pressure Cooker
I love my instant pot for cooking large quantities of food like chili, soup, beans, etc. The only issue is food always comes out kind of mushy, so I only use it for certain things. It's great for bulk vegetable and soup prep

## Steamer
A steamer tray is the best way to cook fresh vegetables. The vetetables retain their flavors instead of being boiled away. It also prevents you from overcooking. 

## Kitchenaid Stand Mixer
It's expensive, but it makes baking so much easier that it's actually worth doing. I do everything in my kitchenaid mixer including proofing bread. 

## Frozen Vegetables
One of the easiest ways to make yourself healthier is to start eating a bag of steam in bag frozen veggies with dinner. They're really quick, healthy, tasty, and satiating.

## Ghee
My favorite high heat cooking oil. It tastes great and doesn't have any crazy industrial chemical processing steps like other high heat oil.

## Avocado Oil
My favorite high heat plant oil. I use this almost every day. Very tasty, healthy, and heat tolerant.

## Macadamia Nut Oil
The tastiest plant oil. Very expensive though.

## MSG
MSG adds a flavor called umami and makes it taste "richer". It comes from natural sources, is naturally present in many foods, and has been used safely[^1] for 100+ years, so I think it's safe to use. I sometimes add a tiny pinch of the powder for added richness.

## Chili Oil
This adds a fantastic warm spice to asian foods. It's chili's infused in oil. Buy a decenty quality one, because they often use a low quality safflower oil as the base.

## Sugar Cane Vinegar
This is essential for Filipino foods, but it's a really good slightly pungent vinegar. Highly reccomended for asian cooking.

## Truffle Salt
Has an amazing pungent indescribable flavor. There are some decent salts available, but quality varies and it goes stale quickly.
