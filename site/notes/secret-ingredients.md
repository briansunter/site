Uncommon ingredients and techniques that improve food. 


## Sous Vide
Cooks foods inside a vaccum bag immersed in hot water. This is my favorite cooking method because it's so easy, the food is so flavorful, and it's good for meal prep and cooking bulk proteins


## Instant Pot Pressure Cooker
I love my instant pot for cooking large quantities of food like chili, soup, beans, etc. The only issue is food always comes out kind of mushy, so I only use it for certain things. It's great for bulk vegetable and soup prep

## Steamer
A steamer tray is the best way to cook fresh vegetables. The vetetables retain their flavors instead of being boiled away. It also prevents you from overcooking. 

## Kitchenaid Stand Mixer
It's expensive, but it makes baking so much easier that it's actually worth doing. I do everything in my kitchenaid mixer including proofing bread. 

## Frozen Vegetables
One of the easiest ways to make yourself healthier is to start eating a bag of steam in bag frozen veggies with dinner. They're really quick, healthy, tasty, and satiating.

## Ghee
My favorite high heat cooking oil. It tastes great and doesn't have any crazy industrial chemical processing steps like other high heat oil.

## Avocado Oil
My favorite high heat plant oil. I use this almost every day. Very tasty, healthy, and heat tolerant.

## Macadamia Nut Oil
The tastiest plant oil. Very expensive though.

## MSG
MSG adds a flavor called umami and makes it taste "richer". It comes from natural sources, is naturally present in many foods, and has been used safely[^1] for 100+ years, so I think it's safe to use. I sometimes add a tiny pinch of the powder for added richness.

## Chili Oil
This adds a fantastic warm spice to asian foods. It's chili's infused in oil. Buy a decenty quality one, because they often use a low quality safflower oil as the base.

## Sugar Cane Vinegar
This is essential for Filipino foods, but it's a really good slightly pungent vinegar. Highly reccomended for asian cooking.

## Truffle Salt
Has an amazing pungent indescribable flavor. There are some decent salts available, but quality varies and it goes stale quickly.

## Shao Xing Wine
Essential for authentic kung apo chicken

## Cojita Cheese

Mexican Parmesaean

##  Doenjang
A salty, savory soybean paste that is
used to season many
Korean dishes, doenjang is fermented in a
similar way to miso
paste, a Japanese
staple, but is much
more robust and rich
in flavor.

## Dumpling Wrappers
Really convenient to have on hand for snacks.

## FISH SAUCE
A popular condiment
made from salt-brined
fish—sharp and salty,
with a deep umami flavor and strong aroma.
Various brands from
across Southeast Asia
can be found in most
supermarkets. Look
for additive-free varieties that list only
anchovy and salt as
ingredients.

## Gojuchiang
This bright red chili
paste is similar to
gochugaru but
blended with glutinous rice and salty
soybean paste. Thick
and sticky, it is often
added to marinades
and sauces.

## Oyster Sauce

OYSTER SAUCE
Made from cookeddown oyster extract
(among other ingredients), oyster sauce is
thick and brown with
a complex salty-sweet

## Hot Sauce

sambal oelek (of
Indonesia), Tabasco
(made in Louisiana),
and chili oil (commonly linked with
Chinese cuisine).

## Reduce spiciness

How to scale
down the spice
in any of Roy’s
recipes
When using fresh or
canned chilies:
Substitute spicy serrano peppers with
milder jalapeños. If
straight jalapeños
are too much, scrape
out the seeds or use
a bell pepper.
When using dried
chilies:
Reduce the amount
of gochugaru
(Korean chili flakes)
called for by half and
replace it with an
equal amount of
smoked paprika.
This will tame the
spiciness without
sacrificing the
vibrant red color and
smokiness that
gochugaru providesi this is a good way of 

## fermented shrimp
SALTED
FERMENTED SHRIMP
This briny, umami-rich
Korean ingredient is
often used to season
dishes in lieu of salt.
It’s also a popular
ingredient for traditional kimchi-making.
Store it in the refrigerator, where it will last
for many months.
