title: Hisense 75H8G TV
---

In September 2020 I purchased a Hisense 75H8G 75 Inch 4K TV from Best Buy.

Hisense is usually considered a budget off brand, so I was wary, but it was 30-50% cheaper than Sony or Samsung TVs at the time. Overall I've been pretty happy with it, but there was one problem.

One day I tried to turn on the TV, but it got stuck on the Hisense Android TV logo. Then it showed red triangles with exclamation marks at the top of the screen. It would stay on this screen for some time, then shut down and restart. 

I tried everything I could find online, including unplugging the tv and waiting as well as holding down the power button, however nothing worked.

Eventually I found this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hisense/comments/ivxzf2/hisense_h9f_stuck_in_boot_loop/) on Reddit which suggested there was a bad Android TV update, and I could fix it by plugging a USB flash drive into my computer.

I contacted customer support and talked to multiple people. One person told me I was out of warranty and out of luck, even when I asked for the firmware update specifically. However, another customer service rep sent me an email with the file and instructions on how to update the TV. I just put the file on the USB drive, plugged it into my computer, and it worked perfectly. Now I keep the TV disconnected from the network and disable all "smart" features. Hopefully this will help someone else out.
