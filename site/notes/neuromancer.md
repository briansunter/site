## What’s it About
A hacker is recruited into a mysterious group to pull off a series of heists.

The book is based in a apocalyptic futuristic world controlled by corporations. Humans are cybernetically enhanced but the quality of life is really bad for everyone. They eat gruel and sleep in tiny 4 foot tall hotel rooms called "coffins". 

A hacker named Case has hit rock bottom after his former employer destroyed his nervous system so he could no longer connect into the virtual reality system called The Matrix. 

A mysterious man called Armitage approaches him and offers to cure him if he helps him in a series of jobs. After being cured he's told they also put poison sacs inside him which will kill him unless he follows through with the job as an insurance policy. 

He works with a hitman called Molly to steal a powerful computer virus and the digital copy of the consciousness of a famous hacker who was killed during a heist. 

They recruit a man called Diego Riviera who can project holograms to those around him. They use him to attract the heir of a powerful corporation to invite them into their space station mansion headquarters. 

After reaching the headquarters, they learn their true employer and their intentions. 

## How I Discovered It
I became intrigued in cyberpunk after playing Cyberpunk 2077. It's generally recommend to read this book before snow crash, trans metropolitan, and cryptonomicon which I want to read next. 

## What I liked
- Setting was really interesting
- Ideas like virtual reality, cyberspace, and the matrix were way ahead of their time in 1984. 
- The plot was interesting and kept me intrigued until the end
- Lots of unexpected twists and I like the theme of human unpredictability. 
- The corporations are so creepy and twisted inside
## What I Disliked
- Characters motivations sometimes weren't clear enough
- Really didn't understand the Molly character
- Could have given a bit more of an epilogue. 
# Quotes
> The sky above the port was the color of a television tuned to a dead channel

> He’d operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a byproduct of youth and proficiency, jacking into a custom cyberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness into the consensual hallucination that was the matrix.

> Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button.


> “For ... years men dreamed of pacts with demons. Only now are such things possible.”

> A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless void….The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he’d cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn’t there.

> The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games,” said the voice-over, “in early graphics programs and military experimentation with cranial jacks.” On the Sony, a two-dimensional space war faded behind a forest of mathematically generated ferns, demonstrating the spacial possibilities of logarithmic spirals; cold blue military footage burned through, lab animals wired into test systems, helmets feeding into fire control circuits of tanks and war planes. 

> “Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts… A graphic representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding....

>Wintermute won’t be the first to have made the same mistake. Underestimating me…He talked with me, Molly. I suppose he talked to all of us. You, and Case, whatever there is of Armitage to talk to. He can’t really understand us, you know. He has his profiles, but those are only statistics. You may be the statistical animal, darling, and Case is nothing but, but I possess a quality unquantifiable by its very nature.” He drank. “And what exactly is that, Peter?” Molly asked, her voice flat. Riviera beamed. “Perversity.”

> I call up the dead. But no, my friend,” and the boy did a little dance, brown feet printing the sand, “I am the dead, and their land.” He laughed. A gull cried. “Stay. If your woman is a ghost, she doesn’t know it. Neither will you.”

> The Villa Straylight is a body grown in upon itself, a Gothic folly. Each space in Straylight is in some way secret, this endless series of chambers linked by passages, by stairwells vaulted like intestines, where the eye is trapped in narrow curves, carried past ornate screens, empty alcoves. The architects of Freeside went to great pains to conceal the fact that the interior of the spindle is arranged with the banal precision of furniture in a hotel room. In Straylight, the hull's inner surface is overgrown with a desperate proliferation of structures, forms flowing, interlocking, rising toward a solid core of microcircuitry, our clan's corporate heart, a cylinder of silicon wormholed with narrow maintenance tunnels, some no wider than a man's hand. The bright crabs burrow there, the drones, alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage.
We have sealed ourselves away behind our money, growing inward, generating a seamless universe of self. The Villa Straylight knows no sky, recorded or otherwise. At the Villa's silicon core is a small room, the only rectilinear chamber in the complex. Here, on a plain pedestal of glass, rests an ornate bust, platinum and cloisonne, studded with lapis and pearl. The bright marbles of its eyes were cut from the synthetic ruby viewport of the ship that brought the first Tessier up the well, and returned for the first Ashpool…
