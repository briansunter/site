## Welcome to my notes

Snippets of thoughts on various interests and hobbies.

This is my digital garden project where I post notes on topics I've been interested in. These are short highly interlinked pages on a wide range of topics. They are different from [blog posts](/blog/), which are long form essays. It's like my own Wikipedia of condensed information that I've found useful, and hopefully others will too.


At the bottom of each page is a section called "Related Pages". This Related Pages section is a list of other pages that link to the current page. This should help you find related topics.

## Index
These are some of my main areas of interest. 

### [[programming]]
Topics related to coding, projects, algorithms, interviewing.
### [[cooking]]
Recipes, cooking techniques, and useful information.

### [[product]]
Things I've bought that I've found useful.
