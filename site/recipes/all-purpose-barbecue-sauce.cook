Place over medium heat, and let the mixture come to a simmer.

Pour the barbecue sauce into a bowl. If you have a smoking gun, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and slide the probe of the gun into the bowl. Fill the bowl with smoke, and remove the probe. Let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Stir, taste, and repeat 2 or 3 more times until smoky to your liking.

Serve how you like it! Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.
