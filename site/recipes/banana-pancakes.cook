Combine @flour{120%g}, @white sugar{13%g}, @baking powder{2%tsp}, and @salt{1%g} in a bowl. Mix together @egg{3}, @milk{240%g}, @avocado oil{26%g}, and @bananas{3} in a second bowl.

Stir flour mixture into banana mixture; batter will be slightly lumpy.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown, ~{5%minutes} per side. Serve hot.
