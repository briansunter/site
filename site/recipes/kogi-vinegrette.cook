>> title: Kogi Vinegrette
>> description: Pungent, kind of acidic, sweet vinaigrette. Flavors of garlic and ginger come singing through, while fragrant Korean chili flakes add just enough spice. Slaws and salads are the most obvious applications, but this vinaigrette can also be drizzled over vegetables, grains, or proteins as a finishing sauce.
