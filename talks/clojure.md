## Slide 1
Elevently can be used with revealjs to make markdown presentations
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/1200/800" -->

## Slide 2
<!-- .slide: data-background="#ff0000" -->

You can still use the fancy theme stuff in markdown with comments
---

# Slide 3
I'm using both the html and markdown file instead of anything fancy. It works out of the box with my framework and 
gives me more flexibility.

# Slide 4

## This finds the square root
This is a code example

``` js
console.log('hello world')
const number1 = 2.25;
const number2 = -4;
const number3 = 'hello';

const result1 = Math.sqrt(number1);
const result2 = Math.sqrt(number2);
const result3 = Math.sqrt(number3);

console.log(`The square root of ${number1} is ${result1}`);
console.log(`The square root of ${number2} is ${result2}`);
console.log(`The square root of ${number3} is ${result3}`);
```
